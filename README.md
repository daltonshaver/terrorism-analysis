# Main Research Focus
The main focus of the research is to determine the similarities and differences of attacks with a high probability of success in three separate Operation Enduring Freedom Area of Operations (AOR). the specific type of attacks that result in the highest success. 
Because of the high number of categorical variables, an analysis dealing with discrete probabilities would be really effective.Â On a conceptual level, I would like to pinpoint the exact combinations that grant the maximum success/casualty rates using some form of optimization. 

## Why do we care?
Insights -> Training -> Increased Mission Effectiveness

By determining the type of attacks that result in the highest success rate, partner nations can focus training and operations on responding and preventing terrorist attacks that are most likely to occur. This will increase military and intelligence efficiency, save money, and most importantly, save lives.

"Effective counter-terrorism strategies must be risk-based, intelligence-driven and comprehensive, employing all elements and aspects of national and international security functions, measures and operations." - NATO CT Reference Curriculum Page 95
"Counter-terrorism operations rely heavily on detailed and actionable information to successfully dismantle terrorist networks." - NATO CT Reference Curriculum Page 103

## Methods
This analysis will focus on comparing and contrasting three components of Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF). Each component represents an Area of Operations that is focused on combatting terrorism within select countries. This allows me to compare how terrorist attacks differ according to geography, group structure, and political situations. 

I will be implementing a [[Logistic Regression]] model. The Logistic Regression model will predict whether an attack was either successful or unsuccessful based on the predictor variables *suicide*, *vicinity*, *gname*, *attacktype1*, *targtype1*, *weaptype1*, and *country*. I will also use the associated predicted probabilities for each observation determined from the Logistic Regression model.

I will examine the frequency counts of each predictor variable for terrorist attacks with a predicted probability of 95% or greater. Using grouped bar charts, I will stratify each predictor variable by mission to compare similarities and differences of what makes terrorist attacks successful. With these results, I would be able to confidently argue which aspects of counterterrorism measures are needed most.

Further research will involve a Zero Inflated [[Poisson Regression]] model. This model will determine the probability distribution of casualty counts. It takes into account the significant number of zeros present in the 'nkill' variable.

## Task List
- Clean up graphics. Find a way to plot *gname* and *country*.

## Research Progress
- I have created three subsets of data which represent three seperate components of Operation Enduring Freedom (specific mission as a part of the War on Terror). The subsets total 22,506 events. The subsets are:
	- OEF-P Philippines (Operation Freedom Eagle), 6,101 attacks
	- OEF-TS Trans Sahara (Operation Juniper Shield), 9,328 attacks
	- OEF-HOA Horn of Africa, 7,077 attacks
- I have examined univariate statistics on all of the variables in each subset.
-  I have organized the terrorist groups ("gname" variable) into more generalized groups in order to create a more accurate Logistic Regression model.
- I have created a High Performance Logistic Regression model that predicts whether the attack will be successful or unsuccessful. 
	- Predicted probabilities for each subset have been exported into three CSV files.
	- I have created a tables that includes all of the coefficient estimates, standard errors, Degrees of Freedom, t values, p-values, and calculated odds.
- I have created bar charts examining the **distributions of attacks with a predicted probability of 95% or greater**. These can be used to determine similarities/differences in the success of varying components of a terrorist attack in three separate regions of the world.
- I have created two maps (Africa, Philippines) displaying the geographic distribution of attacks, colored by success.
- I have created a graphic showing the ROC-AUC Curves stratified by mission.

## Difficulties
- I am unsure of the key differences between the SAS Logistic Procedure and the SAS HPLogistic Procedure.
- Need a concise way to explain ROC curves.

## Problems Solved
- Why is the Degrees of Freedom for all variable levels in the Logistic Regression model infinite?
		- This is the default option for the HPLOGISTIC procedure in SAS, using the z distribution. Setting the DDFM model option to DDFM=RESIDUAL sets the DF to a finite value allowing the use of a t distibution. The two methods are almost identical when using a large sample.

## Background
Over $600 billion spent on Afghanistan/OEF Global War on Terror since 2001. 
100,000+ U.S. troops deployed in Afghanistan/OEF region.
	Can't use these numbers as they refer to mostly Middle East countries, need to find specific numbers for selected AORs.

##### OEF-P Notes:
On September 1, 2017 Secretary of Defense James Mattis designated Operation Pacific Eagle - Philippines as a contingency operation, serving as a continuation of Operation Freedom Eagle. *Page 98 of DOD Operation Pacific Eagle Report (PDF).*
The operation mainly consisted of training the Armed Forces of the Philippines in counter-terrorism operations as well as supporting humanitarian aid.
- Only 15 out of 6101 terrorist attacks in the Philippines were suicide attacks.

Generalized groups consist of the following: 
- New People's Army (NPA): Armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines.
- Islamic Extremists: Groups following a form of Islamic jihadism.
- Moro Insurgents: Muslim-majority armed groups focused on establishing independent state in the Philippines.
- Unknown: Groups with ambiguous names, or groups that lacked any reference online.

##### OEF-HOA Notes:
Generalized groups consist of the following: 
- Islamic Extremists: Groups following a form of Islamic jihadism.
- Regional Militias/Tribes: Ethnic, rebel, or insurgency groups focused on regional interests, such as competing for territory, money, or political power.
- Political Organization: Groups that are formally recognized political parties.
- Unknown: Groups with ambiguous names, or groups that lacked any reference online.

##### OEF-TS Notes:
The Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP) is the central U.S. interagency plan to combat terrorism in Trans-Saharan Africa. OEF-TS is the military combat component of TSCTP. Its predecessor is the Pan Sahel Initiative, focusing on Mali, Niger, Chad, and Mauritania as an initial component of the War on Terrorism beginning in 2002. 
*Countries that OEF-TS explicitly focuses on are stated on page 48 of DOD 2019 Budget (PDF).*

- Maghreb: Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia
- Sub-Sahara: Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal

Generalized groups consist of the following: 
- Islamic Extremists: Groups following a form of Islamic jihadism.
- Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM): Merged with its formally recognized name used prior to 2007. A significant number of attacks were carried out by this group alone.
- Regional Militias/Tribes: Ethnic, rebel, or insurgency groups focused on regional interests, such as competing for territory, money, or political power.
- Unknown: Groups with ambiguous names, or groups that lacked any reference online.

## Results
- Intepretations: 
	- Nearly 50% of attacks with an extremely high predicted chance of success (95%) are kidnappings in the Philippines.
	- Approximately 90% of attacks with a predicted probability of success greater than 95% are located inside a city rather on the outskirts of a city for all three regions analyzed.
	- Over 95% of attacks with an extremely high predicted probability of success (95%) are non-suicide attacks for the Horn of Africa, Trans-Sahara, and Philippines mission components.


## Further Notes
**_This means if the probability of an event happening is >0.5 we usually consider the event to happen or in other words if the chances of an event happening are more than 50% then we can claim that the event will take place, i.e., in this case, it will rain._**

Add 2 digit labels to bar charts.
Make bars wider.
Raise font size.
Put x axis label in all caps.
Change labels



Will remove the Unknown level from final results of the summary analysis of attacks with <= 95% predicted success chance due to there being no relevant insights gained from it. (Also removed "Other" in Weapon Types for the same reason).
