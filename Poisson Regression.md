# Poisson Regression
## Overview
Poisson Regression is used to model response variables that are discrete counts. A Poisson distribution is a tool that helps to predict the probability of certain events happening when you know how often the event has occurred. It gives us the probability of a given number of events happening in a fixed interval of time. Mean and variance should be the same for a Poisson distribution.

## Implementation
Explanatory variables must be continuous apparently, therefore I may need to implement some form of loglinear model.
