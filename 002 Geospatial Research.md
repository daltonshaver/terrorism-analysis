# Main Research Focus
The main focus of the research is to determine the spatial distribution of high concentrations of conflict in Afghanistan following the 2001 invasion by NATO coalition forces.

## Methods
I used spatial autocorrelation and density clustering methods to find patterns of spatial distribution in the data. I also calculated the distance of each individual event and its proximity to the nearest provincial capital and the nearest national highway. Spatial autocorrelation was determined by a Moran Plot and Moran's *I*, which evaulates a district's value compared to the average value of its neighbor. A Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications (DBSCAN) model was used as a complementary method. This detected the clusters of conflict event based on the density of latitude/longitude coordinates. Choropleth maps were utilized to visualize the data derived from these models.

## Background
Operation Enduring Freedom began on October 7, 2001 following the September 11, 2001 attacks. The United States and other NATO forces staged a swift invasion and takeover of the Taliban-ruled government in Afghanistan. The United States created, funded, and trained the Afghan National Army in an attempt to form a security force that would stabilize the country. Both the Taliban and al-Qaeda groups increasingly conducted guerrilla warfare up until NATO’s formal withdrawal in 2014. Beginning in early 2015, the Taliban began staging large offensives against the Government of Afghanistan to seize major cities. The intensity of the war had significantly increased between all warring parties until the reinstatement of Taliban rule on August 15, 2021.

## Conclusions
This analysis aimed to provide insights into the spatial distribution of conflict events over 18 years of war in Afghanistan. The global and local spatial autocorrelation proved to be positive using the Moran’s I statistic, showing districts with similar amounts of conflict are more likely to be clustered together. A greater number of hotspots were found in southern and eastern Afghanistan, particularly close to national highways. Further research in analyzing the spatial distribution of casualties and the specific involvement of belligerents would provide more effective insight into where and how war was conducted in Afghanistan since 2001.
